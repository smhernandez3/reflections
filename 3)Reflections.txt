- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when working with another person on a project 

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

becuase you wante to be able to conroll things. you don't want to push/pull new updates when something might not be entirely ready yet

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: just clones on github. clones hapens from github to ur compuerter. fork just for gH

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

allows you to come back to it 

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Trying to cordinate and figure out the pull requests I think would be tricky.  But once you get a therough unerstating of how the process works, I could see it being a major benifet to project development.
